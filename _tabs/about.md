On this website, you can find documentation, installation guides, and application examples for two software tools:

- **DIVA** : a user-friendly platform that converts raw 3D image stacks into volumetric reconstructions, enabling easy visualisation and quantification in virtual reality (VR) environments without the need for preliminary processing.

- **Hesperos** : a napari plugin that allows for either pre-set manual segmentation or semi-automatic segmentation utilising a one-shot learning algorithm.

The website also details a strategy for using DIVA and Hesperos together to increase the accuracy and streamline the process of manual annotation in artificial intelligence tasks, enabling users to achieve precise annotations and advanced 3D visualisations, while maintaining geometric accuracy during the annotation correction phase.
