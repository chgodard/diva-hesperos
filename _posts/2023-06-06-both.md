<div align="justify">

A new workflow strategy has been designed to refine the accuracy and ease the process of manual annotation in AI applications. By combining DIVA and Hesperos, users gain the ability to perform accurate annotations while accessing detailed 3D visualisations, ensuring geometric constraints are considered throughout the annotation and correction process.

## **NEW FUNCTIONALITY OVERVIEW**
<hr class="title_style">

To take full advantage of virtual reality (VR) visualisation in DIVA and the precise pixel correction offered by the Hesperos plugin, both software platforms have introduced new features that include a system of oriented landmarks. These landmarks help identify areas that need correction or further distinction.


### Oriented landmarks in DIVA  
<hr class="subtitle_style">

In DIVA, the implementation of oriented landmarks includes the introduction of a new VR tool and a new desktop interface. This new version of DIVA is available at our [Github repository diva-hesperos](https://github.com/DecBayComp/diva-hesperos). Orientation data is essential since annotations are typically performed in a 2D environment (refer to the application examples sections).

Within the VR mode, users can activate the **VR Oriented Landmarks** tool by choosing the <img src="https://github.com/DecBayComp/diva-hesperos/assets/49953723/4db44bce-3c7c-4643-89e2-fa66958334b2" width="20px" class="light"/> <img src="https://github.com/DecBayComp/diva-hesperos/assets/49953723/3e7afa45-c70b-471e-93a9-6fde4ac08499" width="20px" class="dark"/> icon from a submenu under the <img src="https://github.com/DecBayComp/diva-hesperos/assets/49953723/93ba7823-3f89-4422-bd8d-a87675d07f13" width="20px" class="light"/> <img src="https://github.com/DecBayComp/diva-hesperos/assets/49953723/67630e01-801b-4895-8968-aa77f7a242b1" width="20px" class="dark"/> icon in the **VR Menu**. This feature allows the addition of landmarks by pressing the <img src="https://github.com/DecBayComp/VoxelLearning/assets/49953723/35c93203-6e80-4a4e-849f-370bf26ba56d" width="15px" class="light"/> <img src="https://github.com/DecBayComp/VoxelLearning/assets/49953723/1d8f5852-b73f-434d-b7d7-cd10dc924cb7" width="15px" class="dark"/> button on the VR controller, which creates a sphere connected to a cylinder that shows orientation. The sphere's center aligns with the VR controller's position at the time of placement, and the controller's direction sets the landmark's orientation. To remove a landmark, align the controller until the landmark turns green, signifying it can be deleted with a press of the <img src="https://github.com/DecBayComp/diva-hesperos/assets/49953723/4928762e-5515-42c9-bd9b-d5410ffc1c39" width="20px" class="light"/> <img src="https://github.com/DecBayComp/diva-hesperos/assets/49953723/4928762e-5515-42c9-bd9b-d5410ffc1c39" width="20px" class="dark"/> button.
> Using the **VR Oriented Landmarks** tool in sync with the **VR Clipper** tool is critical to capture the particular orientation needed to pinpoint anomalies, making navigation more efficient.

Within the Desktop mode, each volume's specific menu appears in blue in the top right corner. The **Oriented Landmarks** interface is reachable via the **VR Annotations** panel by clicking the <img src="https://github.com/DecBayComp/diva-hesperos/assets/49953723/4db44bce-3c7c-4643-89e2-fa66958334b2" width="20px" class="light"/> <img src="https://github.com/DecBayComp/diva-hesperos/assets/49953723/3e7afa45-c70b-471e-93a9-6fde4ac08499" width="20px" class="dark"/> button. This interface lists the oriented landmarks, displaying their ID and coordinates, and offers functionality to export this data. Users can export to a .csv file using the **Export** button or save as a .json file via the **Save** button for subsequent reopening in DIVA. The export file details the sphere’s center coordinates (x, y, z) and the orientations represented by Euler angles. Activate or deactivate all landmarks using the **Toggle** button.


### Oriented landmarks in Hesperos 
<hr class="subtitle_style">
The setup of oriented landmarks in Hesperos involves the creation of a new interface, the Panel 2 presented in the next figure. Here, oriented landmarks are depicted with a white sphere and a yellow segment that denotes their orientation, stored in two separate layers:
- the *`orientations`* layer, a vector layer with orientation segments
- the *`landmarks`* layer, a points layer with the spheres.

<img src="https://github.com/DecBayComp/diva-hesperos/assets/49953723/021357bd-4365-4cfe-a41e-e8aa757755fe" width="1000px"/>

    > Only .json files is supported, organised as {"_oriented_landmarks_parameters":{"_volume_positions":[{"x":255,"y":203,"z":152},{"x":299,"y":373,"z":152}],"_local_rotations":[{"x":0.0,"y":1.0,"z":0.0,"w":0.0},{"x":0.0,"y":1.0,"z":0.0,"w":0.0}]}}
    {: .prompt-warning }

    2. Clicking on the desired location within the image will generate a landmark and automatically close the cross tool. 
        >  The sphere’s center coordinates will align with the mouse or pen’s position on the 2D slice, and its radius is predetermined by the image size. Orientation details are selected based on the 2D visualisation axes.
        {: .prompt-info}
    3. The landmark’s ID will automatically appear in the drop-down menu <img src="https://github.com/DecBayComp/diva-hesperos/assets/49953723/bc5db443-ba82-4cd7-92b8-f011947ec251" width="150px"/> and the <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/201736152-319d8559-dbfc-4e52-aeb3-e8e34445f67a.png" width="25px"/> icon will be checked to indicate its selection.

        > The icon will show as checked if the slice index currently on display matches that of the landmark's center.
        {: .prompt-info}

## **SCENARIO 1: FROM DIVA TO HESPEROS**
<hr class="title_style">

The bi-directional system will be illustrated by demonstrating the oriented landmarks feature, beginning with its application from DIVA to Hesperos. Users in this scenario deal with a segmentation derived from a neural network and are tasked with reviewing this output to detect and correct any anomalies. The aim is to use VR technology in DIVA to pinpoint areas that need precise corrections, which are subsequently carried out in Hesperos.

For detailed steps, refer to the [related post](https://chgodard.github.io/diva-hesperos/posts/diva-user-manual/#data-transformation).
    - Load the multi-channel image into DIVA.
    - Enter the VR environment.
